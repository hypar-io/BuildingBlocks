# Building Blocks
Building Blocks is an open source repository of interrelated functions for the [Hypar](https://hypar.io) platform.
Each of the functions contributes a building system to a generated model such as a building envelope, a facade, or floors.
Feel free to fork this repository to make your own functions for Hypar!
